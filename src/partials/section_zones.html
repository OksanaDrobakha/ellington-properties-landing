        <h2>LOBBY</h2>
        <p>
          Distinctly modern, the lobby at Ellington House is an artsy, edgy
          space with an understated elegance. High floor-to-ceiling windows
          frame the lush greenery of outside while acting as entryways for the
          beautiful natural light to accentuate the soft color palette of the
          lobby.

        <h2>POOL DECK</h2>
        <p>
          It’s almost as if the pool deck at Ellington House was designed to
          bring resort-style entertainment to its residents, with an illuminated
          infinity lap pool providing panoramic views of the iconic Dubai Hills
          Golf Course.

        <h2>FITNESS CENTER</h2>
        <p>
          The fitness center at Ellington House goes beyond the expected
          standards of fitness by catering not only to the varied fitness needs
          of its residents, but also considers their moods, emotions, and
          habits.
